# Bangla-News-Headlines-Categorization using LSTM and GRU


Created a tool that can categorizes the Bengali news headlines into eight category (National, Bangladesh, International, Sports, Entertainment, IT, Editors, Islam) using deep recurrent neural network.
A dataset of 0.1 Million news headlines is created. In built chrome web scrapper and python beautifulsoup  used for scraping the news headlines from different Bengali online news portals such as Dainik Jugantor, Dainik Ittefaq, Dainik Kaler Kontho, Inqilab, bangladesh Pratidin and so on.

Word embeeding feature represtations technique is used for extracting the semantic meaning of the words.

A deep learning model has been built by using a bidirectional gated recurrent network and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM).

Finally, the model performance is evaluated using various evaluation measures such as confusion matrix, accuracy , precision, recall and f1-score
